# Simple_Calorie_Counter
1. Impact I wish to create:

These days everyone wants to be increasingly in control over the decisions that influence their health and wellness, but due to our busy schedule, we are unable to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
Such type of apps can be used by any users who are diet conscious and want to keep a track of the food consumed and how much more they should consume and etc. Hence, this app helps people to maintain a balanced diet.  

2. Detailed Abstract Solution:

•	On opening the app ‘Calorie Counter’, the system would ask a user his/her Email address, DOB, Gender, Height, Weight, Activity level (No or very low, Moderate, High level exercise), Target Weight(the weight that the user wants to have in order to be healthy). 

•	According to the information submitted by the user, the system will automatically set a calorie goal (amount of calories to be consumed in one day) for the user. 

•	After that user would be able to enter the food plus amount of food that they ate for breakfast, lunch, evening snacks, dinner. The system will accordingly calculate the amount of calorie consumed and compare it to calorie goal.
